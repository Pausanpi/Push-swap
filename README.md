# Push-swap

### Passing the Evaluation:
Return 'n' size of instructions fors sorting 'x' number of values:
- If x = 3 then n <= 3
- If x = 5 then n <= 12
- If x = 100 then n < 1500
- If x = 500 then n < 11500

Note: the lesser instruction, the more evaluation points

### Project plan:
- Create the stacks
- Implement swap, rotate, reverse rotate, push
- Choose a sort algorithm
- Pseudo code
- Implement the algorith
- Test with a checker

### What is a stack?
- A stack of objects piled on top of each other
- Has a top, and a bottom

### What is a linked list?
- Data structure containing 'nodes'
- Nodes are data elements
- Each like a box, that stores data inside of it
- E.g. values, or numbers
- Each node, connected in sequence
- The head, connected to the next, and so on
- Singly Linked list: uni-directional
- Doubly Linked list: bi-directional (for this project we will be using this)
- Tail's *next -> NULL
